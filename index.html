                  <h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>
                     This studio course critically engages with moving images. We will generate, manipulate, and
                     animate digital imagery into durative, artistic projects. To develop a broader context
                     around moving images, we will watch, read, create, critique, and discuss. We will screen
                     time-based works and study a collection of texts in relationship to historical,
                     contemporary, and experimental uses of time-based digital media.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     The developments in digital imaging, computer simulation, and animation has shifted notions
                     of cinema and techniques of film/artmaking into ever-evolving forms. In the beginning of
                     this course, we will create a constellation of short, experimental projects that aim to
                     familiarize our art practices with various media, software, techniques, contexts, and
                     implications of animated computer imaging. The later duration of this course is aimed at
                     synthesizing the relevant technical and creative concepts learned throughout the course into
                     a self-directed, final project. Final works will be publicly exhibited at the end of the
                     semester.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Health & Safety Requirements</h3>
                  <p>All students, faculty and staff are required to comply with and stay up to date on all <a
                        href="https://safeandhealthy.osu.edu" target="_blank">university safety and health
                        guidance</a> <span class="print">(https://safeandhealthy.osu.edu)</span>, which includes
                     wearing a face mask in any indoor space and maintaining a safe physical distance at all
                     times. Non-compliance will be warned first and disciplinary actions will be taken for
                     repeated offenses.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Format & Delivery</h3>
                  <p>This is a process-oriented studio. It is comprised of presentations, assignments,
                     participatory activities and exercises, individual and group discussions, and reviews. This
                     course is <span class="highlight">hybrid or in-person</span>. Synchronous Zoom meetings will
                     be used for the introduction of assignments, some demonstrations, breakout group meetings,
                     and group critique discussions. Other activities such as working on assignments and
                     exercises, viewing videos, and reading assignments will be executed synchronously and
                     asynchronously. In-person activities will include demonstrations, presentations, group
                     exercises, and critiques. Weekly announcements will serve to inform when activities will
                     take place.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Departmental Note:</h4>
                  <p>A hybrid course provides online learning opportunities for up to 74% of the semester. That
                     means that up to three-fourths of your in-class meeting time may occur at a distance with
                     the expectation that your full attention will be given to this course during the scheduled
                     two hour and forty minute long meeting times, regardless if you are meeting physically or
                     otherwise.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Credit Hours & Work Expectations</h3>
                  <p>This is a 3-credit-hour, 16-week studio course. According to Ohio State policy, students
                     should expect
                     around 6 hours per week of time spent on direct instruction (instructor content and Carmen
                     activities,
                     for example) in addition to 3 hours of out of class work such as reading, viewing videos and
                     films,
                     exercises, projects, & discord interactions to receive a grade of (C) average. In total,
                     students
                     should be prepared to commit a minimum of 9 hours per week to this course.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Attendance</h3>
                  <p>Please arrive on time for each class session. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you will
                     be marked tardy. Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. The Department of Art
                     acknowledges that illness, family obligations, and other conflicts with your classes do
                     occur from time to time and up to three absences are allowed for any reason during the
                     semester without penalty. All absences from class will be counted, however, and in the
                     instance that you miss three class meetings, you are required to meet us to discuss
                     strategies for avoiding additional absences. Each unexcused absence afterwards will result
                     in one full letter grade deduction (e.g. B+ to C+). Six unexcused absences (20% of the
                     semester) results in a failure of the course. Absences will not be excused after the fact
                     except in extreme circumstances. Illness requires a doctor’s note. Any disputes should be
                     discussed within two weeks.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Departmental Note:</h4>
                  <p>It has been determined that some in-person learning is necessary for you to successfully
                     engage with your instructor and peers, course activities, and to meet learning objectives.
                     Timely and consistent contributions are critical in all formats used to deliver the content
                     of this course. In the instance of class-wide quarantine or campus closure, a course
                     contingency plan has been designed so that we can transition to an exclusively online format
                     if we are required to actuate one. <span class="highlight">Attendance will be taken
                        regardless of delivery format</span>.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Participation</h3>
                  <p>Attendance, productive class activity and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in the
                     assessment of your progress. You are expected to be present and active for the entire class
                     period. Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share
                     your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for class meetings and discussions, offer feedback
                     during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and
                     supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of
                     different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we
                     are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility,
                     apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let us know.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Communication</h3>
                  <p><a href="http://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> <span
                        class="print">(http://discordapp.com/)</span> is used as our primary mode of
                     communication. You are required to signup for an account, join our <a
                        href="https://discord.gg/Xv8rwUv" target="_blank">server</a>, and keep up to date with
                     announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources, readings,
                     screenings, and learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Discord Server Interaction</h3>
                  <p>Ongoing weekly discussions and participation in the Discord server is required. We will use
                     Discord to gather and share resources, respond to readings and peers' works, and to share
                     your work in progress.
                  </p>
                  <p>Each week should feature at least:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Link to your exercise/project with a short description of your learning process,
                        concept, challenges, and triumphs. This way your work is contextualized for your peers
                        in relation to your creative inputs and the readings.
                     </li>
                     <li>Respond to at least two of your peers' exercises and project submissions.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Readings & Discussions</h3>
                  <p>During the semester, you will be assigned readings on a variety of topics. The readings are
                     intended to familiarize you with some of the relevant discussions that relate to the field. Each
                     reading is followed by a prompt. You are to write a written response to the prompt and submit it to
                     the discord server <b><u>before the start of class</b></u>.
                     We will discuss our findings and thoughts with our peers in class. Your participation in
                     these discussions matters. The discussions serve as a dialectical engagement to learn from
                     one another and explore the readings in conversation. Moreover, the readings serve as a
                     foundation for discussing the screenings, which are purposefully picked to convey some of
                     the ideas from the readings in practice.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Projects</h3>
                  <p>Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to
                     one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than
                     one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in
                     projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save
                     issues, software errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your
                     desktop, online, and/or on an external hard drive or USB stick in case your computer is
                     lost.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Data Responsibility</h3>
                  <p>Back up your work. Inevitably, computers crash. Sometimes they get stolen. There are measures
                     that you can take to prevent significant loss of data. These include Cloud back-ups,
                     external devices or disc storage.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Commitment to Equity & Diversity</h3>
                  <p>The classroom is a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and
                     cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge
                     and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use
                     preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs.
                     Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our
                     conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that
                     certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are
                     undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or
                     vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and
                     instructors is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should
                     feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that
                     something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive;
                     instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one
                     another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece
                     of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor. (<a

                  <h4>Departmental Note:</h4>
                  <p>The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body.
                     Our programs and curricula reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to
                     provide opportunities for students to learn more about persons who are different from them.
                     We are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth
                     and dignity of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among
                     each member of our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach \sout{his or
                     her} their own potential. Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status,
                     which is defined as age, color, disability, gender identity or expression, national origin,
                     race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status, is prohibited.

                  <p>The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you
                     anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental
                     health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let us know immediately so that we
                     can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, we may request that
                     you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements
                     with us as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented
                     in a timely fashion. Fore more information contact the SLDS office.

                     Failure to adhere to these requirements will be addressed through standard enforcement
                     mechanisms, and an approach built on escalation, whereby adherence will be reinforced
                     through education, choice and peer support before escalating to disciplinary action whenever
                     possible. Where violations are serious and/or ongoing, however, they will be addressed as
                     follows:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>A student and/or student organization will be referred for disciplinary action where the
                        student and/or student organization's behavior endangers the health or safety of campus
                        community members, on or off campus, and/or fails to comply with the directives outlined
                        in the Safe Campus Requirements. o During an incident in which a student is not
                        adhering, the student should first be asked to comply (e.g., to wear a mask). If this
                        does not resolve the situation, the student should be reminded about safe and healthy
                        requirements. If the student continues to refuse, the student should be told to leave
                        the location and not to return until they are prepared to follow the requirements.
                     </li>
                     <li>For all situations, except those students who quickly comply when reminded, the incident
                        should be reported to the Office of Student Life Student Conduct for potential
                        disciplinary action and to assist with appropriate tracking. Even if the student's name
                        is unknown, a report to Student Conduct should be made to assist the university in
                        evaluating adherence efforts; however, it should be acknowledged that Student Conduct
                        will be unable to take disciplinary action without identifying information.

                  <h3>COVID-19 Related Attendance Concerns and Planned Course Modifications</h3>
                  <p>Students unable to attend class because of positive diagnosis, symptoms, or required
                     quarantine due to exposure will transition course activities to distance learning to the
                     extent that they are able during periods of mandated absence. Students will work with
                     instructors to confirm their ability to participate or alternative learning activities
                     related to course objectives and assignments will be provided.
                  </p>
                  <p>If an entire class is required to quarantine, instruction will transition to online
                     interactions and learning at a distance will occur. All university standards and policies
                     remain in place as related to Title IX, academic misconduct, allowances for students with
                     disabilities, studio conduct and respect for others, and other related issues. We will be
                     meeting and interacting in an online format, not an anonymous one. We will conduct ourselves
                     and treat others as if we are meeting in person.
                  </p>
                  <p>If the university suspends in-person classes, this course will transition to an online
                     delivery mode for the remainder of the semester.
                  </p>
                  <p>If an instructor is unable to attend class in person because of positive COVID-19 diagnosis,
                     symptoms, or required quarantine, a substitute instructor may be assigned to ensure course
                     continuity. If the instructor is able, the course may transition to an online delivery mode
                     temporarily.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Accommodations</h3>
                  <p>In-person classes (as well as the in-person components of hybrid classes) are expected to
                     make <i>reasonable accommodations</i> for students who are unable to be safely present in
                     the classroom <i>and</i> have been approved for an accommodation by the office of Student
                     Life Disability Services (SLDS). For a lecture course, such an accommodation might mean
                     streaming lectures on Zoom or making recordings available to the students. For classes that
                     involve laboratory work, studio work, or a mix of lecture and discussion, a reasonable
                     accommodation will not always be possible. Students are expected to work with their advisors
                     and, where appropriate, SLDS to find workable solutions to their scheduling needs.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Sexual Misconduct/Relationship Violence</h3>
                  <p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights
                     offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied
                     to offenses against other protected categories (e.g., race). If you or someone you know has
                     been sexually harassed or assaulted, you may find the appropriate resources at <a
                        href="http://titleix.osu.edu/" target="_blank">http://titleix.osu.edu/</a>
                     \href{http://titleix.osu.edu/}{http://titleix.osu.edu} or by contacting the Ohio State Title
                     IX Coordinator, Kellie Brennan, at <a href="mailto:titleix@osu.edu"
                        target="_blank">titleix@osu.edu</a>
                  </p>
                  <h3>Trigger Warning</h3>
                  <p>Some content of this course may involve media that may be triggering to some students due to
                     descriptions of and/or scenes depicting acts of violence, acts of war, or sexual violence
                     and its aftermath. If needed, please take care of yourself while watching/reading this
                     material (leaving classroom to take a water/bathroom break, debriefing with a friend,
                     contacting a Sexual Violence Support Coordinator at <a href="tel:614292111"
                        target="_blank">614-292-1111</a>, or Counseling and Consultation Services at <a
                        href="tel:6142925766" target="_blank">614-292-5766</a>, and contacting the instructor if
                     needed). Expectations are that we all will be respectful of our classmates while consuming
                     this media and that we will create a safe space for each other. Failure to show respect to
                     each other may result in dismissal from the class.
                  </p>
                  <h3>General Class and Studio Policies</h3>
                  <p>Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals
                     and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual
                     orientation, gender identity and expression, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided
                     to the instructor and may include the student's legal name unless changed via the University
                     Name Change policy. We will gladly honor your request to address you by another name or
                     gender pronoun. Please advise us of this early in the semester so that we may make
                     appropriate changes to our records.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Tolerance. Required and elective art courses contain content that can include some language,
                     imagery, or dialogue that may be challenging or offend some students. While no student is
                     required to participate in a presentation or discussion of art or design that offends them,
                     it is important to remain open-minded and participate in a cooperative and respectful
                     manner. Art can often challenge our ideas and experiences, and can lead us into some lively
                     discussion, concepts and imagery. Differences (in ideas, perspectives, experiences, etc.)
                     can be positive, productive and educational, challenging and provocative, so please, engage
                     in the exchange of ideas respectfully. Please see us with your concerns as soon as possible.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Please contact us in advance (during the first week of class or as soon as circumstances
                     develop during the term) if you have circumstances that may affect your performance and
                     ability to fulfill your responsibilities in this course.

                                       day-to-day basis? Where are you exposed to images the most? Would you say you
                                       create more than you consume images? Why or why not? What are the most
                                       prevalent "genres" of images that you capture on your phone? What does this
                                       say about you or the devices that we use to take photographs? In the reading,
                                       Cole presents examples of artists who do not take or create images but rather
                                       collects them and represents them in a different context. What is the allure
                                       or aim of these new presentations of mass imagery? Do you think they are valid
                                       efforts at art-making if they themselves did not create the images? Why or why
                                       not?</i><br>

                                          to investigate the materiality of the digital image. Your image will be used
                                          as the top, visual layer (maintaining color) and your video will be used to
                                          manipulate the pixels from the image. It will make more sense when you see it
                                          in action. Just pay attention to the animation and formal qualities of video
                                          you choose. If possible, pick an image and video with simliar aspect ratios to
                                          avoid stretching or cropping.</li> <span class="hiTask"><b>Submit your image

               <p>Exercises in the course are detailed and specific in scope to introduce us to formal and
                  conceptual practices of moving images. Most of the exercises will be done during class in our
                  workshops.
                  Your exercises will be presented in class to launch us into discussions about exploration,
                  process, and form. The skills and techniques gained from our exercises will equipt us with
                  strategies to produce our class projects.

                     <p>Exercise 2 investigates the relationship sound has with the moving image. This exercise
                        is broken down into two parts and involves a partner (only for the second part).</p>

                     <h4>PART ONE</h4>
                     <p>
                        Select a pre-existing video track to work with between 1-2 minutes long. This can be from any
                        source you can get your hands on. It can be a music video you like, a piece of footage you
                        recorded from a trip, an advertisement recording, or a scene from your favorite film, for
                        example. Remove any audio that may accompany the original video track. Create your own audio
                        track by using an video editing program of your choice. You can use field recordings, sound
                        libraries/effects, music, and voice narration.
                        Think about the interaction between the visual material and audio material but <span
                           class="highlight">Do not edit the video.</span> Think about how
                        the sound can change the way we perceive and experience the image.</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>1-2 minute video</li>
                        <li>Video should be 1920 x 1080 in resolution and export as an .MP4 format</li>
                        <li>Name the file "ex_2_p1_lastname_firstname.mp4"</li>
                        <li>Upload the video to the class <a

                     <h4>PART TWO</h4>
                     <p>
                        This second part requires a partner. Swap the same visual track from the first part
                        <b>without sound</b> with your partner. Using their visual sequence selection as the visual
                        track for this exercise,
                        create an audio track to accompany the video. Reiterated from the first part, you can use
                        field recordings, sound libraries/effects, music, and voice narration. Think about the
                        interaction between the visual material and audio material but <span class="highlight">Do not
                           edit the video.</span> Think about how
                        the sound can change the way we perceive and experience the image.

                        create moving images. Create a 30+ second video about anything you like that uses a
                        technique, software, or tool in a way that it is not normally to be used. We will learn
                        about datamoshing, screen recording, and machinima in class. You may use these same
                        methods from class but it is <span class="highlight">highly encouraged</span> that you
                        conceive or find a technique or tool that we did not workshop together in class. Be
                        experimental. Be prepared to explain why the imaging technique you used is
                        unconventional.

                        contain hateful, violent, or offensive material, it may not make it into the collection.

                        To be completed in our class workshop. We will each create a short collage video using only the
                        images from our curated database. This exercise will utilize the exhibition practices
                        inherit in Instagram's grid feature. Collages will be uploaded onto our class Instagram
                        account as they are generated.
                        <ul>
                           <li>Your final output should be 1:1 aspect ratio (square) and 900px resolution or larger</li>

                        <h4>PART THREE</h4>
                        <p>You will do the same as in part two, producing a completely new short collage video but in
                           sequential order. One after another, each student will have 4 days to generate a moving
                           collage using only the
                           images from our curated database. A new rule is that you MUST use one image from the previous
                           person's collage but no more than one.
                        </p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>This exercise is designed to challenge this course's implications of what a "moving
                           image" is. Instead of contextualizing moving images purely within the scope of
                           time-based art (usually resulting in a video format), this exercise asks us to consider
                           how digital images may move within social spaces, digital platforms, data
                           infrastructures; how images today are consumed, curated, manipulated, generated,
                           disseminated, and exhibited; how digital images may contribute to larger technological
                           and social structures in our daily lives.

                                          online, to create a column of digital compost. Therefore, many of the
                                          images that make up the collage are not owned by Cloaque. If any images

                     Digital tools are ideal for sampling pre-existing media elements and remixing - or transforming -
                     them into new creative works. With these tools we have the ability to hybridize, collage, combine,
                     cut, paste and duplicate infinitely. Another strategy is to erase, or relocate elements in order to
                     point out new possibilities or relationships. Consider repurposing existing media in surprising
                     ways to create a personal statement, an alternate reality, a political statement, a poetic
                     statement, or a joining of the past with the future.<span class="highlight">**</span>

                     clearly
                     communicated to others:

                              the work you
                              appropriated? Please explain.

                              software are you using to do so?
                           </li>
                           <li>What room in your creative process

                           <li>Based on all of these reflections, will you be able to accomplish it in

                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>"What Just Happened?" you ask yourself. The last thing you remember is a flash of white light
                     and now you seem to be in some kind of waiting room. You're asked to take a number and have
                     a seat. The blades on the ceiling fan whirl in hypnotic fashion. Slowed-down swing music
                     plays through the intercom speakers. There are other people around you. They are mostly
                     individuals, much older than yourself,
                     but there is a young boy sitting on his father's lap. Both your eyes meet with the same
                     confused
                     gaze. When your number is called, you move to a new room. There
                     are windows that overlook the overcast sky and bare trees against the building. It looks
                     chilly.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     <i>Where is this? Where am I?</i>
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     Everything is too common but the place is unfamiliar. The dull, grey light
                     framed by the windows illuminates the surface of a wooden table. A
                     man sitting at the table gestures toward the empty chair across from
                     him. Taking the cue, you walk towards him and sit down.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Here, you're informed of your recent passing. You're dead. So is everyone else around you.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p> "...I'm sorry for your loss..." the man says. He bows his head and closes
                     his eyes. You're both silent for a few moments.
                  </p>
                  <p>You're informed that you are in an in-between space between life and afterlife <span
                        class="highlight">**</span>. You are to stay here for several weeks where you will be
                     given a private room to live the last of your days and take on a final project.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The man elaborates on this project, "...while you are here, you must select one memory. One
                     memory that was most meaningful or precious to you. Once you have chosen your memory, you
                     will try your best to re-create this memory on video. You can use the many skills, tools,
                     and media already available to you before you arrived here. We will screen these at the end
                     of your stay, along with the others you may have seen in our waiting room earlier today. As
                     soon as you have relived your memory, you will move on. Taking only the memory with you."

                  <p>
                     Develop a project treatment for your video that can be
                     clearly
                     communicated to others. As usual, this proposal is non-binding and subject to change. Your
                     treatment should include a minimum of the following:
                     <ul>
                        <li>A mediated explanation of your chosen memory. You can write
                           it down, do a voice recording, a video recording, or collect media materials related to
                           your
                           memory.
                        </li>
                        <li>A 9-panel storyboard: Your storyboard can be either hand-drawn, digital, or prototyped using
                           3D software. If time permits, explore a combination of these methods to push your sketches
                           closer to your mental image. Your storyboard should plan for a minimum of 2 minutes of
                           animation.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <li>400-word written statement: In your written response, explain your concept, the emotional
                           weight and the mood of the piece, how do you plan to execute it, and what software(s) are you
                           planning to use.</li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Example: “I’m creating a piece about the excessive use of technology and its permeation
                              in daily life…To achieve this my piece will primarily explore an imagined table filled
                              with electronic, gadgets, and trash…I will be using Blender for my 3D needs and After
                              Effects for post-processing and compositing…”</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>References and mood board: You should include a mood board (minimum 10 images/videos) in
                           your proposal that convey your vision more clearly. Use these references to communicate your
                           piece’s mood and environment, as well as materials and visual presentation.</li>
                        <li>Sounds/Music: Submit a minimum of 1 audio pieces that convey the mood of your animation
                           piece. Include these as links in your PDF file.
                        </li>

                  <p>Your final project is an open investigation of your interests and the techniques learned
                     throughout the course that culminate into a single video. Your project must synthesize the course
                     materials and techniques
                     and/or respond to some of the subjects discussed in the class. It must be paired with audio
                     which can be
                     musical, ambient, environmental, or experimental. The required length of the project is 2+ minutes.
                     You are free to explore any topic that interests you. These can range from
                     exploration of advanced and experimental techniques, software and frameworks that were not
                     touched on in the class, social and political issues, personal and interpersonal
                     investigations, investigations of aesthetics, etc. Collaboration, invention, and exploration
                     are highly encouraged. Your final projects will be exhibited online on a dedicated website.
