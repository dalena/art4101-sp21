                  <h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>
                     This studio course critically engages with moving images. We will generate, manipulate, and
                     animate digital imagery into durative, artistic projects. To develop a broader context
                     around moving images, we will watch, read, create, critique, and discuss. We will screen
                     time-based works and study a collection of texts in relationship to historical,
                     contemporary, and experimental uses of time-based digital media.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     The developments in digital imaging, computer simulation, and animation has shifted notions
                     of cinema and techniques of film/artmaking into ever-evolving forms. In the beginning of
                     this course, we will create a constellation of short, experimental projects that aim to
                     familiarize our art practices with various media, software, techniques, contexts, and
                     implications of animated computer imaging. The later duration of this course is aimed at
                     synthesizing the relevant technical and creative concepts learned throughout the course into
                     a self-directed, final project. Final works will be publicly exhibited at the end of the
                     semester.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <span class="highlight">Experimentation with media, non-traditional tools, platforms, and
                     methods are encouraged.</span>
                  <h3>Learning Goals</h3>
                  <ul class="dashed">
                     <li>Create original art using digital imaging, computer animation, and sequencing tools such
                        as Blender, Davinci Resolve/Adobe Premiere, and After Effects
                     </li>

                     <li>Develop a dynamic relationship between strategy and experimentation with moving image
                        concepts and tools
                     </li>
                     <li>Engage with critical discourse around moving images through class screenings, readings,
                        assignments, and critiques
                     </li>
                     <li>Use of technology for the purposes of social, critical, speculative, and artistic
                        exploration
                     </li>
                     <li>Relevant vocabulary and jargon that enables advanced, self-directed studies and practice
                        in related fields
                     </li>
                     <li>Means of exhibition and dissemination of moving image art through screenings,
                        installation, online circulation, & online exhibition
                     </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Format & Delivery</h3>
                  <p>This is a process-oriented studio. It is comprised of assignments (mini-tasks, exercises, &
                     projects), participatory activities (workshops/exercises & presentations), individual and group
                     discussions, and reviews. <span class="highlight">This
                        course is hybrid, though the majority of class sessions will be remote.</span> Due to the nature
                     of this course, having both a physical and digital presence simultaneously is not conducive to a
                     strong learning environment. But it will remain hybrid to ensure students can gain access to the
                     computer labs if they need to. Synchronous Zoom and Mozilla Hubs meetings are used to introduce
                     assignments, view screenings, have group critique and discussions, and most importantly do
                     workshops together. The workshops done in class work towards exercises assigned in the course.
                     Students are expected to complete Mini-tasks (which include readings and responses) and Projects
                     asychronously unless it is an open-studio day or unless otherwise noted in the schedule.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Departmental Note:</h4>
                  <p>A hybrid course provides online learning opportunities for up to 74% of the semester. That
                     means that up to three-fourths of your in-class meeting time may occur at a distance with
                     the expectation that your full attention will be given to this course during the scheduled
                     two hour and forty minute long meeting times, regardless if you are meeting physically or
                     otherwise.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Credit Hours & Work Expectations</h3>
                  <p>This is a 3-credit-hour, 16-week studio course. According to Ohio State policy, students
                     should expect
                     around 6 hours per week of time spent on direct instruction (workshops, screenings, and
                     discussions) in addition to 3 hours of out of class work such as mini-tasks (reading, collecting
                     media, research) and completing your class projects to receive a grade of (C) average. In total,
                     students
                     should be prepared to commit a minimum of 9 hours per week to this course.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Attendance</h3>
                  <p>
                     The successful completion of this course relies on workshop submissions, project updates and
                     submissions, attending zoom and hubs sessions, and student participation in discussions. Timely and
                     consistent contributions are critical to deliver the content of this course.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Timely and productive class activities and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in evaluation
                     of assignments. Please arrive on time for each class session. If you are more than 10 minutes late,
                     you will
                     be marked tardy. Three tardies result in one unexcused absence. All absences from class will be
                     counted, however, and in the
                     instance that you miss three class meetings, I will request to meet with you to discuss concerns
                     pertaining to attendance. The Department of Art recognizes that students may on occasion miss class
                     due to extenuating circumstances such as illness, emergency or other important matters. When this
                     occurs, it is your responsibility to request updates and notes and to review course materials on
                     Carmen. Please communicate attendance concerns with me in a timely manner when appropriate.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Participation</h3>
                  <p>Attendance, productive class activity and meeting in-progress deadlines are factors in the
                     assessment of your progress. You are expected to be present and active for the entire class
                     period. Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class. Do the work, share
                     your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for class meetings and discussions, offer feedback
                     during critiques. This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and
                     supported in learning and taking creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of
                     different backgrounds, perspectives, and identities. Respect each other and this space we
                     are building together. Don’t assume, ask. Remain open, be willing to take responsibility,
                     apologize, and learn. Help each other in this. If you have concerns, please let us know.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Communication</h3>
                  <p><a href="http://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> <span
                        class="print">(http://discordapp.com/)</span> is used as our primary mode of
                     communication. You are required to signup for an account, join our <a
                        href="https://discord.gg/9kHkUJ8h9X" target="_blank">server</a>, and keep up to date with
                     announcements and group discussions. Discord is also used to organize resources, readings,
                     screenings, and learning materials. Here, you will also submit your assignments.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Discord Server Interaction</h3>
                  <p>Ongoing weekly discussions and participation in the Discord server is required. We will use
                     Discord to gather and share resources, respond to readings and peers' works, and to share
                     your work in progress.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Mini-Tasks, Readings, & Discussions</h3>
                  <p>During the semester, you will be assigned Mini-Tasks that include readings, researching and
                     collecting materials, and preparing presentations. Assigned readings are on a variety of topics.
                     The readings are
                     intended to familiarize you with some of the relevant discussions that relate to the field. Each
                     reading is followed by a prompt. You are to write a written response to the prompt and submit it to
                     the discord server <b><u>before the start of class</b></u>.
                     We will discuss our findings and thoughts with our peers in class. Your participation in
                     these discussions matters. The discussions serve as a dialectical engagement to learn from
                     one another and explore the readings in conversation. Moreover, the readings serve as a
                     foundation for discussing the screenings, which are purposefully picked to convey some of
                     the ideas from the readings in practice.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Workshops & Exercises</h3>
                  <p>Workshops and Exercises in class go hand-in-hand. As long as you are present and participating in
                     the class workshops, you should be able to complete each exercise without much time spent outside
                     of class. That means you need to gain access to a second screen to follow along fluidly. Exercises
                     are either completed on in one class session or over the course of several workshop class sessions.
                     See the schedule for more information.</p>

                  <h3>Projects</h3>
                  <p>Projects are due at the start of class on the date assigned. Projects may be turned in up to
                     one week late for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than
                     one week late will not be accepted. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in
                     projects online by the deadline. Extra time will not be given for work lost due to save
                     issues, software errors, computer crash, etc. You should regularly backup your files on your
                     desktop, online, and/or on an external hard drive or USB stick in case your computer is
                     lost.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Grading</h3>
                  <span class="hiGrade">
                     <p>Percentage breakdown is as follows:</p>
                     <ul>

                     </ul>
                     <p>Your work will be assessed according to your overall enthusiasm: The amount of time, effort,
                        and thought you contribute to the course; your willingness to explore, take risks, and
                        expand into a new range of experiences; attention to quality of ideas and quality in
                        execution of your ideas; critical thought; skills in craft according to assignment
                        objectives; an understanding of materials presented in class and an ability to relate course
                        materials to discussions, assignments, and your own art practice.

                  <h3>Data Responsibility</h3>
                  <p>Back up your work. Inevitably, computers crash. Sometimes they get stolen. There are measures
                     that you can take to prevent significant loss of data. These include Cloud back-ups,
                     external devices or disc storage.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Commitment to Equity & Diversity</h3>
                  <p>The classroom is a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and
                     cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge
                     and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use
                     preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs.
                     Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our
                     conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that
                     certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are
                     undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or
                     vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and
                     instructors is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should
                     feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that
                     something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive;
                     instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one
                     another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece
                     of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor. (<a

                  <h4>Departmental Note:</h4>
                  <p>The Ohio State University affirms the importance and value of diversity in the student body.
                     Our programs and curricula reflect our multicultural society and global economy and seek to
                     provide opportunities for students to learn more about persons who are different from them.
                     We are committed to maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth
                     and dignity of every person; fosters sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among
                     each member of our community; and encourages each individual to strive to reach \sout{his or
                     her} their own potential. Discrimination against any individual based upon protected status,
                     which is defined as age, color, disability, gender identity or expression, national origin,
                     race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status, is prohibited.

                  <h2>Departmental Notes & College Policies</h2>
                  <h3>PPE & Related College Covid Policies</h3>
                  <p>Safe campus requirements include but are not limited to wearing masks, hand hygiene, physical
                     distancing, health symptom monitoring, participating in contact tracing, quarantine and
                     isolation, and additional safety expectations detailed at <a href="safeandhealthy.osu.edu"
                        target="_blank">safeandhealthy.osu.edu</a>. All Ohio State students, faculty and staff
                     are expected to meet the behavioral and safety expectations under the Safe Campus
                     Requirements when they physically participate in any university activity, on or off campus.
                     All students, faculty and staff also will be required to perform a daily health check to
                     report body temperature each day they intend to be physically on an Ohio State campus.
                     Failure to adhere to these requirements will be addressed through standard enforcement
                     mechanisms, and an approach built on escalation, whereby adherence will be reinforced
                     through education, choice and peer support before escalating to disciplinary action whenever
                     possible. Where violations are serious and/or ongoing, however, they will be addressed as
                     follows:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>A student and/or student organization will be referred for disciplinary action where the
                        student and/or student organization's behavior endangers the health or safety of campus
                        community members, on or off campus, and/or fails to comply with the directives outlined
                        in the Safe Campus Requirements. o During an incident in which a student is not
                        adhering, the student should first be asked to comply (e.g., to wear a mask). If this
                        does not resolve the situation, the student should be reminded about safe and healthy
                        requirements. If the student continues to refuse, the student should be told to leave
                        the location and not to return until they are prepared to follow the requirements.
                     </li>
                     <li>For all situations, except those students who quickly comply when reminded, the incident
                        should be reported to the Office of Student Life Student Conduct for potential
                        disciplinary action and to assist with appropriate tracking. Even if the student's name
                        is unknown, a report to Student Conduct should be made to assist the university in
                        evaluating adherence efforts; however, it should be acknowledged that Student Conduct
                        will be unable to take disciplinary action without identifying information.

                  <h3>COVID-19 Related Attendance Concerns and Planned Course Modifications</h3>
                  <p>Students unable to attend class because of positive diagnosis, symptoms, or required
                     quarantine due to exposure will transition course activities to distance learning to the
                     extent that they are able during periods of mandated absence. Students will work with
                     instructors to confirm their ability to participate or alternative learning activities
                     related to course objectives and assignments will be provided.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>If an entire class is required to quarantine, instruction will transition to online
                     interactions and learning at a distance will occur. All university standards and policies
                     remain in place as related to Title IX, academic misconduct, allowances for students with
                     disabilities, studio conduct and respect for others, and other related issues. We will be
                     meeting and interacting in an online format, not an anonymous one. We will conduct ourselves
                     and treat others as if we are meeting in person.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>If the university suspends in-person classes, this course will transition to an online
                     delivery mode for the remainder of the semester.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>If an instructor is unable to attend class in person because of positive COVID-19 diagnosis,
                     symptoms, or required quarantine, a substitute instructor may be assigned to ensure course
                     continuity. If the instructor is able, the course may transition to an online delivery mode
                     temporarily.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Accommodations</h3>
                  <p>In-person classes (as well as the in-person components of hybrid classes) are expected to
                     make <i>reasonable accommodations</i> for students who are unable to be safely present in
                     the classroom <i>and</i> have been approved for an accommodation by the office of Student
                     Life Disability Services (SLDS). For a lecture course, such an accommodation might mean
                     streaming lectures on Zoom or making recordings available to the students. For classes that
                     involve laboratory work, studio work, or a mix of lecture and discussion, a reasonable
                     accommodation will not always be possible. Students are expected to work with their advisors
                     and, where appropriate, SLDS to find workable solutions to their scheduling needs.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Grade Forgiveness</h3>
                  <p>The Grade Forgiveness Rule allows undergraduate students to petition to repeat up to three courses.
                     The grade in the repeated course will permanently replace the original grade for the course in the
                     calculation of the student's cumulative GPA.Only a first repeat can be used this way; all other
                     repeats of the same course will be included under the general course repeatability rule.</p><br>
                  <p>The original grade will remain on the student's transcript and some graduate/professional school
                     admission processes will re-calculate the student's GPA to include the original grade. See OSU's <a
                        href="https://advising.osu.edu/grade-forgiveness-0" target="_blank">Grade Forgiveness</a> page
                     for more information.</p>
                  <h3>Sexual Misconduct / Relationship Violence</h3>
                  <p>Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights
                     offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied
                     to offenses against other protected categories (e.g., race). If you or someone you know has
                     been sexually harassed or assaulted, you may find the appropriate resources at <a
                        href="http://titleix.osu.edu/" target="_blank">http://titleix.osu.edu/</a>

                  </p>
                  <h3>Trigger Warning</h3>
                  <p>Some content of this course may involve media that may be triggering to some students due to
                     descriptions of and/or scenes depicting acts of violence, acts of war, or sexual violence
                     and its aftermath. If needed, please take care of yourself while watching/reading this
                     material (leaving classroom to take a water/bathroom break, debriefing with a friend,
                     contacting a Sexual Violence Support Coordinator at <a href="tel:614292111"
                        target="_blank">614-292-1111</a>, or Counseling and Consultation Services at <a
                        href="tel:6142925766" target="_blank">614-292-5766</a>, and contacting the instructor if
                     needed). Expectations are that we all will be respectful of our classmates while consuming
                     this media and that we will create a safe space for each other. Failure to show respect to
                     each other may result in dismissal from the class.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>
                  <p>It is the responsibility of the Committee on Academic Misconduct to investigate or establish
                     procedures for the investigation of all reported cases of student academic misconduct. The term
                     “academic misconduct” includes all forms of student academic misconduct wherever committed;
                     illustrated by, but not limited to, cases of plagiarism and dishonest practices in connection with
                     examinations and artwork created in studio courses. Instructors shall report all instances of
                     alleged academic misconduct to the committee (Faculty Rule 3335-5-487). For additional information,
                     see the <a

                  <p>
                     The Department of Art adheres to all aspects of this Code of Conduct especially in matters relating
                     to the following: Academic Misconduct, Endangering Health or Safety, Sexual Misconduct, Destruction
                     of Property, and Theft/Unauthorized Use of Property.</p>

                  <h3>Reusing Past Work</h3>
                  <p>In general, you are prohibited in university courses from turning in work from a past class to your
                     current class, even if you modify it. If you want to build on past research or revisit a topic
                     explored in previous courses, please discuss the situation with your instructor at the start of the
                     assignment/project.</p>
                  <h3>Disability Services</h3>
                  <p>The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you
                     anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability (including mental
                     health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let us know immediately so that we
                     can privately discuss options. To establish reasonable accommodations, we may request that
                     you register with Student Life Disability Services. After registration, make arrangements
                     with us as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented
                     in a timely fashion. Fore more information contact the SLDS office.

                  <h3>Mental Health Services</h3>
                  <p>As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as
                     strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty
                     concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead
                     to diminished academic performance or reduce a student’s ability to participate in daily
                     activities. The Ohio State University offers services to assist you with addressing these and other
                     concerns you may be experiencing. If you or someone you know are suffering from any of the
                     aforementioned conditions, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health
                     services available on campus via the Office of Student Life’s Counseling and Consultation Service
                     (CCS) by visiting ccs.osu.edu or calling 614-292-5766. CCS is located on the 4th Floor of the
                     Younkin Success Center and 10th Floor of Lincoln Tower. You can reach an on call counselor when CCS

                  <h3>General Class and Studio Policies</h3>
                  <p>Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals
                     and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual
                     orientation, gender identity and expression, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided
                     to the instructor and may include the student's legal name unless changed via the University
                     Name Change policy. We will gladly honor your request to address you by another name or
                     gender pronoun. Please advise us of this early in the semester so that we may make
                     appropriate changes to our records.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Tolerance. Required and elective art courses contain content that can include some language,
                     imagery, or dialogue that may be challenging or offend some students. While no student is
                     required to participate in a presentation or discussion of art or design that offends them,
                     it is important to remain open-minded and participate in a cooperative and respectful
                     manner. Art can often challenge our ideas and experiences, and can lead us into some lively
                     discussion, concepts and imagery. Differences (in ideas, perspectives, experiences, etc.)
                     can be positive, productive and educational, challenging and provocative, so please, engage
                     in the exchange of ideas respectfully. Please see us with your concerns as soon as possible.

                  <br>
                  <p>Please contact us in advance (during the first week of class or as soon as circumstances
                     develop during the term) if you have circumstances that may affect your performance and
                     ability to fulfill your responsibilities in this course.

                                       day-to-day basis? Where are you exposed to images the most? Would you say you
                                       create more than you consume images? Why or why not? What are the most
                                       prevalent "genres" of images that you capture on your phone? What does this
                                       say about you or the devices that we use to take photographs? In the reading,
                                       Cole presents examples of artists who do not take or create images but rather
                                       collects them and represents them in a different context. What is the allure
                                       or aim of these new presentations of mass imagery? Do you think they are valid
                                       efforts at art-making if they themselves did not create the images? Why or why
                                       not?</i><br>

                                       make "obvious, verifiable observations" about a piece of work? After reading
                                       Leeman's piece, how do you see the role of critique in your work or art
                                       practice? Leeman suggests how little trust the public has in their own
                                       experience of art viewing. "A person fully capable of noticing and responding
                                       to a tree outside a gallery crosses the threshold into the gallery and becomes
                                       suddenly unable to muster that same capacity facing a work of art." Would you

               <p>Exercises in the course are detailed and specific in scope to introduce us to formal and
                  conceptual practices of moving images. Most of the exercises will be done during class in our
                  workshops.
                  Your exercises will be presented in class to launch us into discussions about exploration,
                  process, and form. The skills and techniques gained from our exercises will equip us with
                  strategies to produce our class projects.

                     <h4>Description</h4>
                     <p>Create a virtual memory palace that contain media elements collected from your past. Design a
                        floor plan and build it out architecturally in Blender. Collect a variety of media
                        elements from your life or are a reminder of moments from your life (images, videos, audio) and
                        place them spatially throughout your 3D space. You will add
                        3D artifacts that activate the spaces further. Lastly, you will animate the camera throughout
                        your architectural structure to create a moving image work of the space informed by the medial
                        elements and virtual objects composed in your scene. This exercise will challenge you to think
                        creatively about virtual spaces and how the experience of media is informed by spatial
                        composition.

                     <p>Exercise 2 will begin our journey into using Blender's grease pencil. Each student will draw out
                        a linear perspective background and collectively rotoscope an entire animation by delegating a
                        portion of frames among each student. Through the practice of rotoscoping, students will be
                        introduced to how 2D animation works in Blender's Grease Pencil. By the end of this exercise, we
                        will combine the disparate background scenes and rotoscoping animation into a single video to
                        create an exquisite corpse-style moving image work.</p>

                     <h4>Description</h4>
                     <p>Exercise X is a semester-long collaborative project in which we will experiment with the
                        creation, curation, and dissemination of digital images in a networked society. It is
                        separated into two parts:
                        <h4>PART ONE</h4>
                        Collect <b><u>10 gifs</u></b>.
                        Your can use Giphy, Imgur, Tenor, Google Images, DuckDuckGo, Twitter, Instagram, Are.na, Tumblr,
                        Pintrest,
                        Facebook, Amazon, Reddit,
                        Flickr, and so on ++ <i class="highlight">Your selected images will contribute to a
                           collective database for
                           class collaging.</i> Be mindful of your peers and the content that we will be engaged
                        with. I will use my own discretion to moderate the collection of images. If images submitted
                        contain hateful, violent, or offensive material, it may not make it into the collection.
                        <ul>
                           <li>Images should be larger than 200px</li>
                           <li>Name each image file from 0 to 9 (for example: 0.gifs, 1.gifs, 2.gifs, and so on)</li>
                           <li>Compress all images into a .zip and name it "ex_X_lastname_firstname"</li>
                           <li>Upload your .zip to the <a
                                 href="https://osu.app.box.com/f/32b1c399703945b4bfa13df0e768311d"

                        </ul>
                        <h4>PART TWO</h4>
                        To be completed in our class workshop. We will each create a short collage video using only the
                        images from our curated database. This exercise will utilize the exhibition practices
                        inherit in Instagram's grid feature. Collages will be uploaded onto our class Instagram
                        account as they are generated.
                        <ul>
                           <li>Your final output should be 1:1 aspect ratio (square) and 900px resolution or larger</li>
                           <li>Export as an .mp4</li>
                           <li>Name the video file "ex_X_pt2_lastname_firstname.mp4"</li>
                           <li>Upload your file to the <a
                                 href="https://osu.app.box.com/f/1a130125bfb44344b78b6edb41d7a595"
                                 target="_blank">dropbox</a></li>
                           <li>Upload your video to your Vimeo account</li>
                           <li>Submit your Vimeo link to the class Discord server:
                              EXERCISES ⇒ #exercise-x2</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>PART THREE</h4>
                        <p>You will do the same as in part two, producing a completely new short collage video but in
                           sequential order. One after another, each student will have 4 days to generate a moving
                           collage using only the
                           images from our curated database. A new rule is that you MUST use one image from the previous
                           person's collage but no more than one.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Your final output should be 1:1 aspect ratio (square) and 900px resolution or larger</li>
                           <li>Export as an .mp4</li>
                           <li>Name the video file "ex_X_pt3_lastname_firstname.mp4"</li>
                           <li>Upload your file to the <a
                                 href="https://osu.app.box.com/f/dfd145a550304920b6865cb127bb79cc"
                                 target="_blank">dropbox</a></li>
                           <li>Upload your video to your Vimeo account</li>
                           <li>Submit your Vimeo link to the class Discord server:
                              EXERCISES ⇒ #exercise-x3 & tag the next person scheduled after you
                              to let them know it is their turn</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This exercise is designed to challenge this course's implications of what a "moving
                           image" is. Instead of contextualizing moving images purely within the scope of
                           time-based art (usually resulting in a video format), this exercise asks us to consider
                           how digital images may move within social spaces, digital platforms, data
                           infrastructures; how images today are consumed, curated, manipulated, generated,
                           disseminated, and exhibited; how digital images may contribute to larger technological
                           and social structures in our daily lives.

                  related media from your project and a written summary of the tasks or progress you've made. If you are
                  having issues or concerns on your project, this is the time to express them. Weekly checkpoints are
                  crucial to ensure you are on track to finishing your projects. You will be graded on these updates.

               <div id='p1-content' class='toggle' style='display:block;'>
                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>"What Just Happened?" you ask yourself. The last thing you remember is a flash of white light
                     and now you seem to be in some kind of waiting room. You're asked to take a number and have
                     a seat. The blades on the ceiling fan whirl in hypnotic fashion. Slowed-down swing music
                     plays through the intercom speakers. There are other people around you. They are mostly
                     individuals, much older than yourself,
                     but there is a young boy sitting on his father's lap. Both your eyes meet with the same
                     confused
                     gaze. When your number is called, you move to a new room. There
                     are windows that overlook the overcast sky and bare trees against the building. It looks
                     chilly.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     <i>Where is this? Where am I?</i>
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     Everything is too common but the place is unfamiliar. The dull, grey light
                     framed by the windows illuminates the surface of a wooden table. A
                     man sitting at the table gestures toward the empty chair across from
                     him. Taking the cue, you walk towards him and sit down.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Here, you're informed of your recent passing. You're dead. So is everyone else around you.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p> "...I'm sorry for your loss..." the man says. He bows his head and closes
                     his eyes. You're both silent for a few moments.
                  </p>
                  <p>You're informed that you are in an in-between space between life and afterlife <span
                        class="highlight">**</span>. You are to stay here for several weeks where you will be
                     given a private room to live the last of your days and take on a final project.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The man elaborates on this project, "...while you are here, you must select one memory. One
                     memory that was most meaningful or precious to you. Once you have chosen your memory, you
                     will try your best to re-create this memory on video. You can use the many skills, tools,
                     and media already available to you before you arrived here. We will screen these at the end
                     of your stay, along with the others you may have seen in our waiting room earlier today. As
                     soon as you have relived your memory, you will move on. Taking only the memory with you."
                  </p><br>
                  <p><i>This effort to represent memories using media is more a creative endeavor than an accurate
                        one-to-one depiction of what actually happened and what you remember. How can you
                        situate the video you make for this project in this volatile, affective reality?</i>
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     <span class="highlight">**</span> <i>afterlife is used subjectively and can mean anything (or
                        nothing) to you.</i>

                  <p>
                     Develop a project proposal for your video that can be
                     clearly
                     communicated to others. As usual, this proposal is non-binding and subject to change. Your
                     proposal should include a minimum of the following:
                     <ul>
                        <li>A mediated explanation of your chosen memory. You can write
                           it down, do a voice recording, a video recording, or collect media materials related to
                           your
                           memory.
                        </li>
                        <li>A 9-panel storyboard: Your storyboard can be either hand-drawn, digital, or prototyped using
                           3D software. If time permits, explore a combination of these methods to push your sketches
                           closer to your mental image. Your storyboard should plan for a minimum of 2 minutes of
                           animation.</li>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <li>400-word written statement: In your written response, explain your concept, the emotional
                           weight and the mood of the piece, how do you plan to execute it, and what software(s) are you
                           planning to use.</li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Example: “I’m creating a piece about the excessive use of technology and its permeation
                              in daily life…To achieve this my piece will primarily explore an imagined table filled
                              with electronic, gadgets, and trash…I will be using Blender for my 3D needs and After
                              Effects for post-processing and compositing…”</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>References and mood board: You should include a mood board (minimum 10 images/videos) in
                           your proposal that convey your vision more clearly. Use these references to communicate your
                           piece’s mood and environment, as well as materials and visual presentation.</li>
                        <li>Sounds/Music: Submit a minimum of 1 audio pieces that convey the mood of your animation
                           piece. Include these as links in your PDF file.
                        </li>
                        <li>Export your proposal as a PDF</li>

                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>Your final project is an open investigation of your interests and the techniques learned
                     throughout the course that culminate into a single video. Your project must synthesize the course
                     materials and techniques
                     and/or respond to some of the subjects discussed in the class. It must be paired with audio
                     which can be
                     musical, ambient, environmental, or experimental. The required length of the project is 2+ minutes.
                     You are free to explore any topic that interests you. These can range from
                     exploration of advanced and experimental techniques, software and frameworks that were not
                     touched on in the class, social and political issues, personal and interpersonal
                     investigations, investigations of aesthetics, etc. Collaboration, invention, and exploration
                     are highly encouraged. Your final projects will be exhibited online on a dedicated website.

                  <p>Squash & Stretch is used to create the illusion of weight and preserve the volume in an animated
                     character or object. If we add more squash and stretch to an object it becomes clear to the viewer
                     that what we're animating is pliable and malleble. If we add little or no squash, the object comes
                     across as rigid and inflexible. Not only can you use it to define a subjects weight,
                     flexibility, and volume, but you can also use it to exaggerate gestures. </p> <br>

                  <p>Anticipation is the build up to an action. It is used to add clarity and suspense to the subjects
                     that we animate. Furthermore, you make actions more realistic by creating anticipation. There are
                     three steps when incorporating principles of anticipation: Prepare the viewer for the action. Carry
                     out the animation. Remind the viewer of the action that just occurred.

                     As an example, consider how it may look if you were to kick a ball on the ground in front of you
                     without extending your leg backwards before doing so. It would look unnatural or be flat and
                     lifeless. </p> <br>

                  <br>
                  <p>Staging is a way of composing your animation so that the idea is clear and concise (not distracting). Think of how an audience would understand a stage play and where the eyes are compelled towards based on the elements and performers on the stage and how this aspect forms a narrative. This is a broad principle that determines where your characters are in the frame, where objects are positioned, what the camera is looking at, and what positions things move towards. A form of visual rhythm and composition.</p> <br>

                  <p>Many actions in life do not start and stop instantaneously. Either because of gravitational pull or
                     due to a subject's weight, its start speed may be slower than its constant speed and it will
                     gradually decelerate until coming to a stop. By using ease in and ease out, one can create
                     animations that look less abrupt and more natural while emphasizing the middle step of the
                     animation. You can demonstrate sudden impact with by witholding the use of ease in and ease out
                     consequently. Like a bowling ball hitting pins. </p> <br>

                  <br>
                  Timing & Spacing is crucial in order to create believable and appealing movement. Timing & Spacing
                  characterize the weight and define the movement of a subject. For instance, we can guess that an
                  animated object has little weight if its movements are swift or it takes little time for the object
                  to accelerate and decelerate. On the otherhand, a slower moving animated subject can tell us that
                  it is maybe heavier and more massive.
                  <br>
                  The timing of an animation is considered the beat or the time it takes to get from one gesture to
                  the next. You can break down a subject's action into beats. First, the subjects initial pose.
                  Second, the subject's anticipatory pose, third, the subject's action, and fourth, the subject's
                  rest pose. These beats represent the extreme gestures of the subject's actions. The spacing is the
                  motion in-between each of the beats in an animation. Adjusting the timing and spacing of your
                  animation can alter the style and create variations of dramatic effect.</p> <br>

                  <p>Arcs depict the curved path of action an object should travel in for the motion to look convincing.
                     In life, movement rarely occurs in a straight line. Even humans doing a forward stride have slight
                     vertical up and down arcs in their motion. By adding arcs, movements can look less mechanical and
                     more organic. Arcs give us a sense of the law of physics. When you throw a ball across the room,
                     the ball follows a natural arc due to gravity.

                  <p>Seconary actions aim to support or emphasize the main action happening in a scene. By adding
                     secondary actions, they can create dimension to subjects. A good example is creating subtle
                     movement to the hair of your character as they walk or jump up and down. The main action is the
                     walking and the secondary is the bounce or wave of the hair as they walk.

                  <p>Follow-through and overlapping action are related topics that can accomplist the same goal of
                     realistic motion. Follow-through is an idea that appendages or accessories of subjects continue to
                     move even when the motion is finished. If a character with a purse is running and suddenly come to
                     a halt, the purse may fly forward beyond the position of the idle body and fall back where the
                     character stopped. Think of being in a car that suddenly brakes and the way the body may jolt
                     forward before being constrained by the safety belt as an example as well. <br>
                     Overlapping action is when different parts of the body or attachments of a subject move at
                     different rates. When walking, your arms may have a different speed than your head.

                  <p>Straight Ahead Action and Pose-to-Pose are two different methods to animate movement. With straight
                     ahead action, your draw each frame one by one until the the animation is complete. With
                     pose-to-pose, you draw a few frames throughout the scene to control the timing and motion and then
                     you go back to fill in the missing frames. Benefits of straight head action is that the motion is
                     often smoother. The problem with it is that it is hard to plan the complete motion. With
                     pose-to-pose, you have control of consistency but the motion may be less fluid.

                  <p>Solid drawing ensures that your objects have the correst shape, mass, and weight. Most subjects can
                     be broken down into 3 dimensions of cubes, spheres, or cylinders. This is about drawing
                     characteristics of your subject in proportion to itself and other surrounding subjects in the
                     environment.

                  <p>Appeal is defined as anything that the viewer is attracted to whether they "like" or "dislike" what
                     they see is less the point. This ranges from the character's design to their mannerisms. An
                     important aspect of appeal is to keep things simple and clear to read while also giving your
                     subject a personality. Appeal has no easy formula and often can be attributed to aspects outside of
                     animation like character design, world building, and narrative. This is very subjective and can
                     also incorporate a combination of animation principles.
