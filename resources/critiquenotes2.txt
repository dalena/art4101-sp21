Critique

What have been critiques like at OSU? What is their format? 

Critiques are different every time. There is no standard and it is dynamic. Your contributions or lack of them contribute to the overall interaction as a group. There are so many different schools of thought on how to critique. They are really interesting places for you as the artist and for the work itself to be in the mode of being critiqued. 

I had a great friend who facilitated a critique with the graduate students at UCLA who said that giving critiques are a gift to the artist. This doesn't mean that they are supposed to be kind or nice or a pool of compliments about the artist or their work. But rather that a critique is something you give with care and attention to the work, the context, and the artist's intention. And from the other representation, as an artist whose work is being critiqued, it is for them a way to look at their work that they haven't seen it from.

What questions get asked during critiques or responses to work during critique are made?
--What are you trying to say?
--Did you think about?
--Did you mean to?
--Why did you?
--It reminds me of
--I wish this part were...

Unborn sibling
--Art direction
--Technical limitations or challenges

Reflection
--This reminds me of... is sometimes gratifying and useful for students getting technically acquainted with their own work but it can often deflect from the work into a space where we read the work only by relationship to something else/other/outside.


Cold reads
Obvious observations of a work help to establish a common reality and impression of the work from a formal level. We can articulate conn

Intention
Assume everything you see is intended. By seeing a work as full intended we remove the pressure of investigation in order to be more intimate with the work. "When you assume intention, you give the artist a respect they can grow into."
